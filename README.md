# Why I am using GitHub?

In 2013 I did a volunteering research internship at [INAOE Robotic's Lab](http://ccc.inaoep.mx/grupos/robotica.php)
where I played around with Markovito, a patrol service robot, and some accelerometers
to create a [DANCE DEMO Human-Robot Interaction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw-lZam_qZI).
Specifically, I started my adventures in [GitHub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub) 
because of the [GitHub repository of Jordan Frank](https://github.com/jwf/tdetools).
By then, I didn't realise the importance of learning such important skills that
help me to learn programming in different languages (e.g. R, C++, and GitHub). 
Then, I was just astonished about the variate of open accessed projects in GitHub 
and joined GitHub on March 8, 2015.
Today, April 10, 2018, pretty much three years after join GitHub, I feel 
that I am very far away to use the full potential of GitHub. So,
I am still learning from all the GitHub community. Additionally
to that, a reason that keep me going using GitHub is the following extract of 
 [Gousios et al. 2014](https://bvasiles.github.io/papers/lean-ghtorrent.pdf)

> "During recent years, [GitHub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub),
founded in 2008, has become the largest code host in the world, with more
than 5M developers collaborating across 10M repositories.
Due to its support for distributed
version control (Git) and pull-based development [2], as well as
its modern Web UI and focus on social coding [ [4] ](http://www.jsntsay.com/publications/dabbish-cscw2012.pdf),
GitHub has quickly surpassed
in size and popularity even much older forges such as Sourceforge (1999).
GitHub offers a tremendous research potential. For instance, it is
a flagship for current open source development, a place for developers to
showcase their expertise to peers or potential recruiters, and
the platform where social coding features or pull requests emerged."
